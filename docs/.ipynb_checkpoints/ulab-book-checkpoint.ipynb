    "`ndarrays` are efficient containers of numerical data of the same type (i.e., signed/unsigned chars, signed/unsigned integers or `float`s, which, depending on the platform, can also be `double`s). Beyond storing the actual data, the type definition has eight additional members (on top of the `base` type). Namely, `dense`, which tells us, whether the array is dense or sparse (more on this later), the `dtype`, which tells us, how the bytes are to be interpreted. Moreover, the `itemsize`, which stores the size of a single entry in the array, `boolean`, an unsigned integer, which determines, whether the arrays is to be treated as a set of Booleans, or as numerical data, `ndim`, the number of dimensions (`uint8_t`), `len`, the length of the array, the shape (`*size_t`), the strides (`*size_t`). The length is the product of the numbers in `shape`.\n",

Note that $|s_1| > |s_2| > ... > |s_{k-1}| > |s_k|$, even if the tensor is sparse. The statement is trivial for dense tensors, and it follows from the definition of $s_i$.

Hence, if we start from the very beginning, ($n_i = 0$ for all $i$), and walk along the linear RAM segment, we increment the value of $n_k$ as long as $n_k < l_k$. Once $n_k = l_k$, we have to reset $n_k$ to 0, and increment $n_{k-1}$ by one. After each such round, $n_{k-1}$ will be incremented by one, as long as $n_{k-1} < l_{k-1}$.

    "## Iterating over two ndarrays simultaneously: broadcasting\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we invoke a binary operator, call a function with two arguments of `ndarray` type, or assign something to an `ndarray`, we have to iterate over two views at the same time. The task is trivial, if the two `ndarray`s in question have the same shape (but not necessarily the same set of strides), because in this case, we can still iterate in the same loop. All that happens is that we move two data pointers in sync.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem becomes a bit more involving, when the shapes of the two `ndarray`s are not identical. For such cases, `numpy` defines so-called broadcasting, which boils down to two rules. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The shapes in the tensor with lower rank has to be prepended with axes of size 1 till the two ranks become equal.\n",
    "2. Along all axes the two tensors should have the same size, or one of the sizes must be 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "If, after applying the first rule the second is not satisfied, the two `ndarray`s cannot be broadcast together. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let us suppose that we have two compatible `ndarray`s, i.e., after applying the first rule, the second is satisfied. How do we iterate over the elements in the tensors? \n",
    "\n",
    "We should recall, what exactly we do, when iterating over a single array: normally, we move the data pointer by the last stride, except, when we arrive at a dimension boundary (when the last axis is exhausted). At that point, we move the pointer by an amount dictated by the strides. And this is the key: *dictated by the strides*. Now, if we have two arrays that are originally not compatible, we define new strides for them, and use these in the iteration. With that, we are back to the case, where we had two compatible arrays. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let us look at the second broadcasting rule: if the two arrays have the same size, we take both `ndarray`s' strides along that axis. If, on the other hand, one of the `ndarray`s is of length 1 along one of its axes, we set the corresponding strides to 0. This will ensure that the data pointer is not moved, while we iterate over both `ndarray`s at the same time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, in order to implement broadcasting, we first have to check, whether the two above-mentioned rules can be satisfied, and if so, we have to find the two new sets strides. "
